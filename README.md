# Kernel
A simple kernel intended to run on low-end computer and being as simplistic as possible.

this project isn't intended to be released and working as soon as possible,
as i said in my lib, i wan't to take my time, go back and do things properly,
i don't wan't to rush and do things without understanding them.
right now i know i don't have the skills and understanding to do a nice userspace.
But i wan't to learn, and i will even if i die trying.

## note

for now i will try to have something that boot,
working on my computer (x86_64/AMD64)
